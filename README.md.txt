# 1) Resource Management Simulation

This Python simulation, developed by me, represents the Budget Management scenario from the IE 211 - Introduction to Algorithms course.
It shows my ability to translate textual inputs into numerical outputs and simulate an industrial engineering process, specifically resource allocation and percentage analysis.

# 2) Data Preprocessing and EDA Practice
The project includes simple Python script demonstrating basic data preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
It was created for practice and improving fundamental data analysis skills.
